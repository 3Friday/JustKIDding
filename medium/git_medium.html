	<p>When you write a lot of code, eventually you will want to go back to a previous version that you wrote. For that, we use a little program called <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">git.</a></p>
	<p>To start working on a project you can:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>create a folder with some documents in your computer and write in the terminal "git init" (without the quotes;</li>
		<li>go to github and create a new repository and add there some files and download them with "git clone" and the link on the right side of the project.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>After you make some more changes you should add them to the staging area.</p>
