	<p>So we learned a lot, but another way to learn even more is to look at code. Reading other people's code can be advantageous because you get a glimpse of a real project.</p>
	<p>We did a little bit of that, when we used the programmer/ developper tools.</p>
	<p>Now, we will take a look at this site's code witch is stored in the so called repo. Repo stands for repository and is something like a folder where all the files for a particular project are stored.</p>
	<a href="https://github.com/3Friday/justKIDding" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank" class = "center-btn">Let's go to the repo!</a>
	<p>First, we have some stats. The number of commits indicates how many changes have been done to the code. We will see more in depth what a branch is, but basically it allows us to separate own experiment from the main branch where is the stable and reliable version of our code. The releases show when you think your project is ready for the public, and then when major changes have happened. The last one, contributors, counts the number of people that have worked on this project.</p>
	<p>Then, do you see a colorful ribbon on top of of it? Click it! It will show you which languages are used in the repo.</p>
	<p>Now let's take a look at the right side of the repo. There we have the Code (where we currently are), Issues (what needs fixing), Pull requests (these are propesed changes to the code) and Wiki (where we can put some more info about our project). Follows a bit of administrative details about our repo.</p>
	<p>Also we have the possibility to download the project to our computer so that we can review it in peace.</p>
	<p>And of course in the middle of the page are the files that form this site that you are looking at. Click on the index.html file and take a look at the comments.</p>
