	<h1>Let set you up with more fancy text editor and learn a few useful tricks!</h1>
	<p>Choose the language that you use, or check out what the program automatically detect it to be. That is the programming language. Just go to View>Syntax</p>
	<p>Look, now your lines are numbered.</p>
	<p>Multiple cursors, the coolest feature</p>
	<p>If you need a console in order to execute a bit of code, like for Javascript, you can go to View>Show Console</p>
	<p>To find a word in multiple files, for example you left a code word where there was something to finish, right-click the main folder of your project which should be at the right side of Sublime and choose Find in Folder....Then type your search term, that is the word that you are searching. To open one of the files just click on the text.</p>
	<p>Type "html" (without the quotes) and press the tab key. That is the button on the left side of the keyboard; it may have an arrow like this -->| on it! See what happened. This functionality for the "html" snipped is predefined, which means it is put there by the creators of Sublime. But you can define your own. In the menu, just go to Tools>New snippet...</p>
	<p>How to comment/ uncomment a piece of text. Just press ctrl + /. If you are new to using keyboard shortcuts, also called hot keys, this means that you press the Control button which is usually in the bottom left corner of the keyboard and while you are still holding it down, you press the / button, which is probably somewhere on the right side.</p>
	<p>ctrl + L selects a whole line</p>
	<p>shift + tab removes the indentation</p>
	<p>ctrl + > goes to the next word</p>
	<p>ctrl+J makes multiple lines into one line</p>
	<p>ctrl+shift+(arrow) to move the line up or down.</p>
	<p>If you want to know more like this go to Tools>Command palette. You can search there or just take a look.</p>
	<p>F6 brings spell check</p>
	<p>And finally in order to open your document and check how it looks, right-click and choose Open in Browser</p>
