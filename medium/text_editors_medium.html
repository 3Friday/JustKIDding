	<p>The text editor is usually the place where you should write your code. Using a plain and simple text editor such as Notepad is fine. But using a more fancy one can automate some of the things you do, which means that it helps you write easier and faster. It gives you hints. Text editors are also colo(u)r coded which means that for example the elements are blue, the plain text is white, etc.</p>
	<p>Some of the most popular are: <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime text</a>, <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> (which is github's version, we will talk about github later) <a href="http://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a>.</p>
	<p>Later we will get through the process of installing and setting up Sublime so stay tuned!</p>
