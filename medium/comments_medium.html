	<p>People forget. People use other's code. That is why we want to make notes in our code. They should not appear on your page but are helpful. We call them comments.</p>
	
<!-- Look, we can leave some whitespace, so it looks nicer. -->

	<ul><h2>This is how you write a comment in:</h2>
	<!-- Notice that below we want to display a text that is not supposed to show. In that case, we replace one of the characters with the so called character entities. You don't have to remember them but when you need them just search on the internet and you will find a lot of cheatsheets. -->
		<li><b>HTML:</b> <p>&lt;!-- Here is a comment in HTML. You can use it to mark the beginning and end of an element, put a reminder on what to do, and so on. --&gt;</p></li>
		<li><b>CSS:</b><p> /* This is a CSS comment that can be written on a single or multiple lines. You can use it to separate the section for the main page and other pages. It also makes your code more readble. */</p></li>
		<li><b>Javascript:</b><p>// Using these two slashes, you can make a comment on a single line, else you can use the same syntax as in the css file.</p></li>
	</ul>

	<p>You do not have to repeat the obvious, but commenting your code can be useful for you at a later time or to someone else that want to continue or expand the project you are working on.</p>
	<p>So leave tips! Leave whitespace. And remove the confusion!</p>
