		<h>The story so far</h>
		<p>A long time ago in a quaint but foreboding village, a skeleton lived. They were happy: near the loved ones, the chocolate factory and the whole mountain as their playground.</p>
		<p> But a volcanic dragon was sleeping in a cave not so far. The monster would awake in an year. Everybody was getting ready.</p>
