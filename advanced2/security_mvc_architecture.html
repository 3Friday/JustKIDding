	<h2>Security</h2>
		<p>If we are making a more complex app, we might want to protect some data.</p>
		<p>For example, we might want no one to see a user's password, name or any other sensitive information.</p>
		<p>We also want our site to be accessible. But if the topic discussed is controversial, someone can decide to take it down.</p>
		<p>We want to prevent that.</p>
	<h2>The MVC paradigm</h2>
		<p>Used frequently for web applications</p>
		<p><b>Model</b> (logic, business rules): describes the associations between the objects and manipulates the data</p>
		<p><b>View</b> (presentation): displayed to the user</p>
		<p><b>Controller</b>: manages the requests</p>
	<h2>Architectural styles</h2>
		<p>An architectural pattern or style is a way to describe how an app is organised: what are its elements and how they are connected.</p>
		<p>MVC is such a pattern. Other such patterns are: Publishâ€“subscribe, Active Record, Data access object, etc.</p>
