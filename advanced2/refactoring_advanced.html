	<h2>What is refactoring?</h2>
	<p>Refactoring is rewriting your code to make it clearer and easier to modify.</p>
	<p>When writing code we usually add another class or method one by one. But at some point, it all just becomes too complex. Then we want to review our code and make it easy to understand and by extention easy to build upon and quickly in case you want to add some feature some time in the future.</p>
	<p>Remove duplicate code</p>
	<p>You can spot bugs and fix bugs</p>
	<p>Bad smells</p>
	<p>Break it down or consolidate</p>
	<p>Make sure all the names are meaningful</p>
