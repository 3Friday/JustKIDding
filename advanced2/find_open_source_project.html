	<h2>Find an open source project to work on</h2>
		<p>Now that you have sufficient experience with writing your own code, you might want to put it to the benefit of the community.</p>
		<p>A good place to start looking is github's <a href="https://github.com/trending">trending page</a> where some of the most popular repositories are listed. And you can be sure they are active too.</p>
		<p>You can also search by language or interest. Are you eager to go into game development? Maybe emojis are your thing? Or creating beautiful templates?</p>
		<p>You don't have to do it all on your own. Join an existing project.</p>
		<p>Another option is to join <a href="http://freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a> where you can learn some more back end JavaScript and help out build websites for non profit organisations.</p>

	<h2>The choice is made. What's next?</h2>
		<p>First step is to read carefully the guidelines for contributing if any.</p>
		<p>Most important, before doing anything, get to know the code. Fork the repository or clone it locally (on your computer).</p>
		<p>Now, did you spot a bug? Do you have an idea about a new feature? Get digging!</p>
		<p>Pull requests</p>
		<p>You might receive comments before your code is accepted. Read them and make changes if necessary.</p>
