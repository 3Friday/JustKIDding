	<p>Regular expressions are a way to search for a particular string.</p>
	<p>Using \ to escape some charaters.</p>
	<p>A rande is written as [0-9], and \d is common character group for digits.</p>
	<p>To match everything except the written characters, we use caret ( ^ ) in front.</p>
	<p>There are special characters such as \ and + that have a particular role in the language but we might want to find them in a string as is.</p>
	<p>Used mainly behind the scenes?</p>
