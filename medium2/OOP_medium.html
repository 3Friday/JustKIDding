	<h2>Object-oriented programming (OOP)</h2>
		<p>Objects interacting, not a series of steps</p>
		<p>We use data modeling to think what are the events that occur</p>
		<p>Attributes: an object contains not only its properties (name, color, size) but also the thing you can do to it, i.e. methods</p>
		<p>Interfaces: the point of contact between a class and what is outside</p>
		<p>Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritence, Polymorphism</p>
