	<title>PHP: Servers, registration and cookies</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Servers</h2>
		<p>With HTML, CSS and JavaScript we didn't need to pretend there is another computer at the other end to deliver the files like the web pages. But to use the back-end technologies (PHP, Ruby, Python) we do.</p>
		<p>The most used web server is called Apache.</p>
		<p>localhost and ports</p>

	<h2>Cookies and Sessions</h2>
		<p>Why do we need them? HTTP is a stateless protocol.</p>
		<p>Cookies are small files with identification numbers that websites put on your computer to know your preferences.</p>
		<p>Sessions accomplish the same goal, except they are stored on the server. They are stored in a flat file or a database. They can be bigger files because not sent each time through the network. Also more secure. They are erased when the browser is closed.</p>
		
	<h2>Registration</h2>
		<p>We saw how to create pages that are displayed the same way to everybody. But if we want the user to be able to customize what they see, we need them to register or sign up.</p>
		<p>Authentication (make sure that is indeed you) and Authorization (give you the right to do some thing but not other)</p>
