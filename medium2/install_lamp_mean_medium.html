	<h2>Install W/LAMP or MEAN</h2>
		<p>In order to develop an app that has interactions between a user and a server, you have to put on your computer a program that simulates the former. Usually you won't install just the server but a whole kit that contains the server, the database and various other tools.</p>
		<p>The most popular such bundles are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>LAMP, sometimes WAMP = Linux/ Windows + Apache + MySQL + PHP/ Python/ Perl</li>
				<li>MEAN = MongoDB + Express + Node.JS + Angular JS</li>
			</ul>
		<p>They are both roughly composed by a front end, a back end, and a database (and a server).</p>
		<p>The databases are: MySQL and MongoDB.</p>
		<p>The front end is usually Javascript in the LAMP, and AngularJS and Express.</p>
		<p>And the back end is PHP in one case and NodeJS in the other.</p>
		<p>The server is named Apache, but as Javascript is interpreted with no problem by the browser MEAN doesn't need one.</p>
