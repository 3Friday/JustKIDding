	<p>You need to debug when something doesn't work right or you get an error. And you will need a lot of patience for that. And humbleness too. And maybe a cup of cocoa milk.</p>
	<ul>Types of errors:
		<li>Syntax error: Ah, the missing semicolon/ parentheses/ quotes, the misspelled command name or the extra space you left. Every programmer knows that feeling. Don't worry. Just get back to your code with fresh eyes: let it sit for a while, read it from the end towards the begining or tilt your head. You can try many ways until you find the little bugger! Read carefully what the error says as usually there is the number of the line where the error occured... or it is pretty close.</li>
		<li>Runtime error: you can catch this type of error only in the wild, that is when the code is executed.</li>
		<li>Semantic error</li>
		<li>Logic error: everything looks fine but you don't get the result that you were looking for.</li>
		<li>Browser error: not everyone uses the up to date browser so maybe in some instances your code is not dispalyed/ executed as it is supposed to be.</li>
		<li>Other errors</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Don't despair! Help is always on the way. You can try to search the internet or ask a question on a forum. If you have a buddy that knows a little more, why not ask them!</p>
	<p>Some ways to check: put a border around an element, print something or log it in the console, set a breakpoint.</p>
	<p>To make things easy, try to write your code clearly and orderly. Indent, put comments, choose meaningful names.</p>
