<p>When working on your own project you will have to search how to do something new. Let's imagine we want to put a button but we forgot what is the tag for it.</p>
<p>You have two options: search for "html + the term you want to check" (in this case 'button') or click <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_button.asp" target="_blank">here</a>. It should look like this:</p>
<img src="../media/w3s_button.jpg" alt="The w3school's page on button.">
<p>Let's now take a look at the page. You might have noticed a green button "Try it yourself". Click it and see what happens!</p>
