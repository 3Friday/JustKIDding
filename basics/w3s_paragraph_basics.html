<p>When working on your own project you will have to search hoe to do something new. Let's imagine we want to put a paragraph but we forgot what is the tag for it.</p>
<p>You have two options: search for "html + the term you want to check" (in this case paragraph) or click <a href = "http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp">here</a>. It should look like this</p>
<img src="../media/w3s_paragraph.jpg" alt="The w3school's page on paragraph.">
<p>Let's now take a look at the page. You might have noticed a green button "Try it yourself". Click it and see what happens!</p>
