			<li><h3>Learn not to fear all the strange words that programmers use</h3></li>
				<p>Have you tried to learn coding but you stumble on the words. It is true that coders sometimes use one word with different meanings, or multiple word to point at the same thing. So we try to explain claerly what each word or abbreviation means, so that you can stop worrying about it and go ahead and start creating your projects.</p>
			<li><h3>Get to know the basic technologies of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h3></li>
				<p>For us to communicate with our computer and with the computers that send us the webpages we see placed all around the world called servers, we need to know their languages. But don't worry, they use far less words than in English.</p>
			<li><h3>Then learn how to code using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages</h3></li>
				<p>Let`s find out together the secrets of how to manage the information you receive on the other end with SQL, PHP and Ruby/ Python (Don't worry we will explain what each of those mean!) That is how sites like Snapchat and Twitter remember your name and preferences.</p>
			<li><h3>Accompany the friendly skeleton Paige in a journey through coding!</h3></li>
				<p>Even if you know how to make a webpage, there is a lot more to know about the interwebz. Our sweet skeleton will show you more of their virtual land. Join them in learning about the series of tubes they have to travel in order to reach you, how to find an address on the world wide web and explore where a website lives.</p>
