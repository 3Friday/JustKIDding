	<p>Terminal, shell, command line: what is it and how to use it</p>
	<p>Once upon a time if you wanted the computer to do something you had to type a command. Now we can just click. But typing still can give us power.</p>
	<p>Folders in the terminal are called directories. You can:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>print the working directory which means to see where you are at the moment: pwd</li>
		<li>change the directory where you are: cd</li>
		<li>see ,or list, the files that are inside the directory: ls</li>
		<li>create (or make) and delete (or remove) the directory: mkdir and rmdir</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Another useful thing is to manipulate files:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>create them: touch</li>
		<li>copy them: cp</li>
		<li>move or rename them: mv</li>
		<li>delete them: rm</li>
		<li>cat</li>
		<li>grep</li>
		<li>view them: less and more</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Wildcards are symbols we use to replace a character we don't know when searching: * and ?</p>
	<p>Reading, writing and executing permissions.</p>
