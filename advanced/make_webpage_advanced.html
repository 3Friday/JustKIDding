	<p>Let's work on own first major project. This is how you present yourself.</p>
	<p>For inspiration, think of a favourite celebrity: an actor, a musician or an author. Take a look at their site!</p>
	<p>Write about yourself.</p>
	<p>Put up some links to your social media accounts so people can find and talk to you.</p>
	<p>Write about your hobbies: do you like collecting rocks, leaves or stamps. Are you awesome at riding a skateboard? Do you draw? Do you make collages? Take pictures!</p>
