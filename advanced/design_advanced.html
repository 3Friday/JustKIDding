	<p>They say that 90% of design is typography. We already saw how to install fonts but now lets make it pretty.
	<ul><h2>How to match the title fonts with the one in the body.</h2>
		<li><b>Typeface vs. font:</b> art and its embodiment.</li>
		<li><b>Serif vs. sans serif:</b> usually we want one of each.</li>
		<li><b>Font famalies:</b> have a backup in case the browser hasn't downloaded the file or doesn't support it.</li>
		<li><b>Font size, style/ weight and variant:</b> bigger is better?; bold/ italic; uppercase /normal/ small caps.</li>
		<li><b>Text align, decoration, indent and shadow:</b> left/ center/ right; none, underline, overline, line-through, and inherit; how big of an indent and shadow.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p>Another important thing is colo(u)r: of the text, backgrounds. Also transparency. And patterns.</p>
	<p>Spacing: blank spaces allow our mind and eyes to rest. Between paragraphs, between lines and between words.</p>
