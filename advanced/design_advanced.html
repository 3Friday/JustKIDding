	<p>They say that 90% of design is typography. We already saw how to install fonts but now lets make it pretty.
		<ul><h2>How to match the title fonts with the one in the body</h2>
		<li><b>Typeface vs. font:</b> art and its embodiment.</li>
		<li><b>Serif vs. sans serif:</b> usually we want one of each.</li>
		<li><b>Font famalies:</b> have a backup in case the browser hasn't downloaded the file or doesn't support it.</li>
		<li><b>Font size, style/ weight and variant:</b> bigger is better?; bold/ italic; uppercase /normal/ small caps.</li>
		<li><b>Text align, decoration, indent and shadow:</b> left/ center/ right; none, underline, overline, line-through, and inherit; how big of an indent and shadow.</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p>Another important thing is colo(u)r: of the text, backgrounds. Also transparency. And patterns.
		<ul><h2>Get to know the color wheel</h2>
			<li><b>Primary and secondary colors</b></li>
			<li><b>Warm and cold colors</b></li>
			<li><b>What does a color signify and how thay affect our mood</b></li>
			<li><b>Matching colors:</b> look at a picture that you like and extract the colors from there or pick a palette from the <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/">colour lovers'</a> site</li>
			<li><b>Vector vs raster graphics</b></li>
		</ul></p>
	<p>Spacing: blank spaces allow our mind and eyes to rest. Between paragraphs, between lines and between words.
		<h2>What is negative space?</h2></p>
	<p>What is your canvas? Grids (fluid and fixed), ratios and the rule of thirds<ul><h2>The importance of balance</h2>
			<li><b>Ratios:</b>remember that for school you had to buy A4 block papers, that is one example of a sheet that has determined width and height, the relationship between which is called ratio; another example is the size of a screen.</li>
			<li><b>Grids:</b> should the layout be flexible or do you want more control?</li>
			<li><b>Golden section</b></li>
		</ul></p>
