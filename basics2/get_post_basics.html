	<title>GET and POST requests</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the way that your computer communicates with the computer where the web page that you want to view is located.</p>
	<p>In order to exchange information the client (that is your device) and the server (that is the machine that hosts a page that you try to view) send each other requests.</p>
	<p>The two most common HTTP request methods are called GET and POST.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>GET is just like saying "Site, please give me your sweet, precious data!"</li>
		<li>POST is when you want the server to send you personalized page based on what you tell it to</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Of course, usually GET is safer but it also shows you the same as for anyone else. And it may be faster because it doesn't have to process your data and put together a new page with just the right type of info especially for you. But alas, trade offs have to be made.</p>
	<p>OK, now that we know what these requests are we can see them in action.</p>
	<p>Press F12 to bring up your developer toolkit as we saw before. Go to the network tab and refresh the page. You can do that either by the refresh button or F5 on the keyboard. You see what happened?</p>
