<body>
<p>SQL is a database language, we can use it more easily with tools such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>We must always have a primary key, a unique and unchangeable identifier. Cannot be null.</p>
<p>A foreign key is the primary key from another table, so it can be repeated.</p>
<p>Every table should describe just one thing, for example, a student. If something requires multiple inputs, such as classes taken, then put them in a separate table.</p>
<p>Commands in SQL are types with CAPITAL LETTERS, such as CREATE, USE, SELECT, DESCRIBE and DROP.</p>
<p>Each record is created by using the INSERT... INTO.</p>
<p>The main role of sql is to perform queries, i.e. to find the information we need.</p>
<p>Numeric (TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUM INT, INT, BIGINT, FLOAT and DOUBLE), string (CHAR, VARCHAR, BLOB, ENUM, SET), and date & time (DATE, TIME, DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, YEAR) types</p>
<p>GRANT and DENY access to users</p>
