	<h2>What is data?</h2>
		<p>Where does it come from?</p>
		<p>Types of data: Qualitative/ Quantitative, Categorical, Discrete/ Continuous, Unstructured/ Structured</p>
		<p>Data types: strings, numbers (integers, floats), date, Boolean, null, etc.</p>
		<p>Groupings of data (composite and abstract): lists, arrays, hashes, sets, records, objects, classes, etc.</p>
		<p>Data> Information> Knowledge</p>
	<h2>Most important stuff on databases</h2>
		<p>We must always have a primary key, a unique and unchangeable identifier. Cannot be null.</p>
		<p>A foreign key is the primary key from another table, so it can be repeated.</p>
		<p>Every table should describe just one thing, for example, a student. If something requires multiple inputs, such as classes taken, then put them in a separate table.</p>
		<p>Link tables</p>
		<p>The name of the database should be in singular (ex. student, not students).</p>
