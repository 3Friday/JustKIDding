	<h2>IP address</h2>
		<p>Just like people have addresses, devices and web pages have their own address, the Internet Protocol Address, also called IP address. Computers have addresses. Wireless printers have addresses so you can sent your documents to them. Websites have addresses: usually they look like www.google.com but in reality when you type it you are redirected to an IP address such as 64.233.160.0. Try to type it in the browser's address bar.</p>
