	<h2>Data science: graphs, statistics and networks</h2>
	<p>After you have collected it, the data don't have to just sit there. Databases are used to get ratios, insights and ultimately to help make decisions.</p>
	<p>We, humans, are not very good at glancing at a lot of data and drawing conclusions.</p>
	<p>The role of the computer is to make all that data meaningful and useful. That can happen through statistics and visualization.</p>
	<p>Data science is part programming, part statistics.</p>
	<p>The most commonly used programming languages by data scientists are R and Python. Also they use other tools such as SQL and Excel.</p>
	<p>The stages of working with data are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Gathering</li>
		<li>Processing: integrating, aggregating, filtering, sorting, cleansing and transforming data</li>
		<li>Analyzing: finding correlations, averages</li>
		<li>Communicating: explaining and visualizing data</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Graphs, errors in data, Central limit theorem, Bayesian theorem, networks</p>
