	<p>You might not have heard the word "parsing" but you have done it.</p>
	<p>Parsing is just reading and trying to understand. So it is a term from both linguistics (the science of language) and computer science.</p>
	<p>Just like you string one word after the other to get the meaning of what is written.</p>
	<p>Computer do the same but they do it in reverse order: from right to left.</p>
	<p>Some languages parse the code all at once and other do it line by line when you tell them to execute that program.</p>
